Very very ambitious...

This was my second game project after taking C++ seriously.
Darn this was a long time ago and that really shows...

Other than the fact it looks like an ancient flash game ( and sort of plays like one )
This is maybe the worst C++ code I will ever write ( well SDL Pong comes to mind but that actually plays fine and correctly so I'll let it slide because it works the right way )

Problems:
  - I didn't discover delta time so framerate issues can actually break the game
  - Framerate issues everywhere. I did not optimize the collision AI or rendering which makes this 2D game run like s**t in "intense" situations.
  - The same problems that plagued my other earlier ventures into game programming
  
While I plan to remake these two memories of mine. That won't come for a long time.
